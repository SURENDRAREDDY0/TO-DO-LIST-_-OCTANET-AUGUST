# TO-DO-LIST-_-OCTANET-AUGUST
create a to-do list for web development:

Step 1: Set up the HTML structure
Start by creating a new HTML file and open it in a text editor. Begin with the basic HTML structure by adding the <!DOCTYPE html> declaration, <html> tags, and the <head> section.

Step 2: Add the title
Inside the <head> section, add a <title> tag to give your web page a title. For example, <title>To-Do List</title>.

Step 3: Create the body
Within the <body> tags, you can start building the to-do list. Begin by adding a heading to indicate that it is a to-do list. For example, <h1>My To-Do List</h1>.

Step 4: Add an input field and button
Next, create an input field where users can enter their tasks. Use the <input> tag with the type attribute set to "text". Add a button next to it using the <button> tag. Give both elements unique IDs for easy identification.

Step 5: Create an unordered list
Use the <ul> tag to create an unordered list that will hold the tasks. Each task will be represented by an <li> (list item) tag.

Step 6: Add JavaScript functionality
To make the to-do list interactive, you'll need to use JavaScript. Add a <script> tag before the closing </body> tag to include your JavaScript code. Use the DOM (Document Object Model) to manipulate the HTML elements.

Step 7: Write JavaScript functions
Inside the <script> tags, define JavaScript functions to handle adding tasks and marking them as complete. These functions will be triggered by user actions such as clicking the button or pressing Enter after typing a task.

Step 8: Link JavaScript functions to HTML elements
Use JavaScript to select the input field, button, and list elements by their IDs. Add event listeners to the button and input field to call the respective JavaScript functions when triggered.

Step 9: Style your to-do list
To make your to-do list visually appealing, you can add CSS styles. Create a <style> tag within the <head> section and define styles for the various HTML elements used in your to-do list.

Step 10: Test and refine
Save your HTML file and open it in a web browser. Test the functionality of your to-do list by adding tasks, marking them as complete, and checking if they are displayed correctly. Make any necessary adjustments to improve the user experience.

That's it! By following these steps, you can create a simple to-do list using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS in web development.
